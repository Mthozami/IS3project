## This is the Information Systems 3 Assignment 3


### Brief Overview of the Assignment
We are a group of six final-year students who collaborated to develop a Library Management System aimed at small to medium-scale enterprises. The system is designed to offer free access to books within the community under specific terms and conditions. Users are required to visit the library so that they can get registered in-person by a librarian, and after they got registered, they can log into the system to view their borrowing history, Fines history, Payment history and update their personal information. Each user may borrow only one book at a time for a period of seven days. Failure to return the book on time results in a fine of R25 per day. In cases of a lost or damaged book, the user will be responsible for an additional fee of R600 as a replacement of that book. If a book is reported as lost on the due date, only the R600 fee will be applied without the daily fine. Once the fine is paid, users will be able to view his payment history where we are issuing a receipt number which serve as proof of payment among the details in the payments history of that particular user.
